This creates:
- `users` table (for login system)
- `messages` table (for storing chat messages)

## Application Flow (How It Works)

1. **User registers** using username, email, and password  
2. Password is hashed using SHA-256  
3. User logs in → Servlet verifies credentials  
4. Session is created for logged-in user  
5. User is redirected to chat page  
6. User sends messages → Stored in DB  
7. Chat page displays all messages from database  
8. User can logout anytime → Session ends  

This ensures a clear demonstration of Servlet-based session management and request handling.
