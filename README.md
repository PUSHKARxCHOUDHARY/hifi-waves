# Hifi Waves – Web-Based Chat Application

Hifi Waves is a fully structured Java-based web application that enables user communication through a shared chat interface.  
The system is developed using **Java Servlets, JSP, JDBC, MySQL, and MVC architecture**, making it ideal for academic submission and demonstration of core Java-based web development concepts.

This project emphasizes:
- Clear problem understanding & design approach  
- Efficient use of Java features  
- Database integration using JDBC  
- Web application development using Servlets & JSP  
- Clean folder structure for maximum marks

## Project Overview

The main objective of Hifi Waves is to provide a simple, interactive chat room where multiple users can communicate by sending and receiving messages.  
Every message is stored in a MySQL database and displayed in chronological order.

The project is deliberately kept light, clean, and easy to understand so it perfectly fits BCA/MCA/B.Tech Web Technologies submission requirements.
